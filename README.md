const App: FC = () => (
  <>
    <Input label='Label' />
    <Button>Button</Button>
  </>
);

export default App;
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

### Node version

First of all let's use version 21 of node so we don't have compatibility problems, for this we can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) just run in the repository folder the command:

```bash
$ nvm use
```

This command will look for the .nvmrc file and will find the version with which the project was created.
